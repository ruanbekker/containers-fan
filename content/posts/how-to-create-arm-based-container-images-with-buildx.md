This is a short post on how to create container images with docker and buildx so that itâ€™s compatible with ARM architectures such as the Apple M1 and Raspberry Pi 64 bit.

## Dockerfile

We will have a simple dockerfile that runs from a alpine image and we will be installing curl:

```
FROM alpine:latest
LABEL maintainer "Ruan Bekker"
RUN apk --no-cache add curl
```

## Buildx

List your current builder instances:

```
$ docker buildx ls
NAME/NODE        DRIVER/ENDPOINT             STATUS   PLATFORMS
default                  docker default                     running    linux/amd64, linux/386
```

As you can see we only have amd64 and i386 architecture support for when we build container images.

Create a build instance that supports arm64 and arm:

```bash
$ docker buildx create --name multi-arch \
  --platform "linux/arm64,linux/amd64,linux/arm/v7" \
  --driver "docker-container"
```

Now we can update our default builder instance:

```bash
$ docker buildx use multi-arch
```

## Build and Push

If you want to push to your image registry (using an assumption its docker hub):

```bash
$ docker login
```

Now we can build and push our container image with multi-arch support to our image registry:

```
$ docker buildx build \
  --platform "linux/amd64,linux/arm64,linux/arm/v7" \
  --tag ruanbekker/curl:test \
  --push .
```

When you head over to my dockerhub repository:

- https://hub.docker.com/r/ruanbekker/containers/tags

You will see the digests for each architecture that we included:

## Test on Apple M1

If we test this by running a container from our container image on a Apple M1, we will see that it will use the correct digest hash:

```bash
$ docker run -it ruanbekker/curl:test sh
